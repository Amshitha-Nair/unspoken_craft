This is a Web Development Project named "Unspoken Craft". 
It is an E-commerce website intended for Handicraft and Handloom articlles of India to protect the authenticity and the treasure of our country 'Indian Artisans' who have a real talent at making beautiul things out of what we consider as useless.
This was a group project developed by 4 members: https://github.com/atharvi06, https://github.com/ishika-debug & myself.
